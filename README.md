Adds Umbrellas to stylishly protect you from the elements!
- Umbrellas can be crafted with 5 leather and 2 sticks
- Umbrellas protect you from the heat and the rain (any effects based on exposure to the sky will not happen)
  - e.g. zombies given umbrellas will not burn, mobs set on fire will not be extinguished by rain, etc.
  - This effect applies in a radius, meaning you can **shelter other players/mobs** under your umbrella by just being near them
  - This mod will work with the **Origins Mod** and almost every Origins Mod datapack/addon, meaning it can protect hydrophobic origins from rain or origins that burn in the sun
  - It should also work with pretty much any mod that checks if you're exposed to the sky/sun/rain in some way, but obviously I can't guarantee 100% of mods will work
- Durability is lost while doing so (can be disabled in config), but this can be mitigated with Unbreaking and Mending
- They can be **dyed** in any single color (like other leather items)
- They can have **Umbrella Patterns** (similar to Banner Patterns) applied for even more customisation, including a number of pride flags!
- The mod also adds two custom enchantments:
  - **Gliding**, which gives you a slow falling-like effect when held in the main hand
  - **Wind Catching**, which allows you to be boosted up by the smoke of heat sources
- Umbrellas can also be placed in **Umbrella Stands**
  - Umbrella stands display the umbrellas at the correct scale so that they can be used in builds
  - They still provide shelter from the rain, but don't lose durability in the process, so you don't need to worry about the rain damaging your builds

Most of these features can also be enabled/disabled/changed via the config screen!

Depends on my Core mod, [PneumonoCore](https://modrinth.com/mod/pneumono_core)
