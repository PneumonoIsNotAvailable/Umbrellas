Adds Umbrellas to stylishly protect you from the elements!
- Umbrellas can be crafted with 5 leather and 2 sticks
- Umbrellas protect you from the heat and the rain (any effects based on exposure to rain/sunlight will not happen)
  - e.g. zombies given umbrellas will not burn, mobs set on fire will not be extinguished by rain, etc.
  - This effect applies in a radius, meaning you can shelter other players/mobs under your umbrella by just being near them
  - Although this mod is not specifically designed for the Origins Mod, it DOES work with it, meaning it can protect hydrophobic origins or origins that burn in the sun
- They can be dyed in any single color (like other leather items)
  - They can also be made into Pride Flag umbrellas
- They can be enchanted with Gliding, which gives you a slow falling-like effect when held in the main hand. Now you can pretend to be either Mary Poppins or a Fortnite character, depending on your sense of humor!
  - Gliding also allows entities to be boosted upwards by campfire smoke
