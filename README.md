# Umbrellas

[Modrinth Page](https://modrinth.com/project/dgTb67Ox)

Adds Umbrellas to stylishly protect you from the elements!

The main purpose of Umbrellas is to protect any hydro/heliophobic players in the [Origins Mod](https://modrinth.com/project/3BeIrqZR), but Origins isn't a required dependency,
and the mod has been coded to block all sky/rain checks from any mod for maximum compatibility.

### Features

Umbrellas shield you from any sky or rain-related effects, for example zombies burning in the daylight, or players playing as Enderians with the Origins mod.
They use up durability while doing so (can be disabled in config).

Looms can be used to decorate Umbrellas, like banners. There are also several special umbrellas, such as a flowering azalea, or a giant jellyfish.
Umbrellas you create can be displayed in umbrella stands, where they can protect you from the rain without losing durability (so there's no need to worry about builds being ruined by rain!)

The mod also adds enchantments for umbrellas that allow you to glide down from high places, or boost upwards in the smoke from campfires.
There is a (disabled by default) config option that applies the campfire boosting mechanic from umbrellas to Elytra, as well as one that can disable rockets, for players that think the mechanic is a good way to balance Elytra.

### Dependencies

Umbrellas depends on my core mod, [PneumonoCore](https://modrinth.com/project/ZLKQjA7t), however this is included in the mod and does not need to be downloaded separately.
