Adds Umbrellas to stylishly protect you from the elements!
- Umbrellas can be crafted with 5 leather and 2 sticks
- Umbrellas protect you from the heat and the rain (any effects based on exposure to rain/sunlight will not happen)
  - e.g. zombies given umbrellas will not burn, mobs set on fire will not be extinguished by rain, etc.
  - This effect applies in a radius, meaning you can shelter other players/mobs under your umbrella by just being near them
  - This mod will work with the **Origins Mod** and almost every Origins Mod datapack/addon, meaning it can protect hydrophobic origins from rain or origins that burn in the sun
- They can be dyed in any single color (like other leather items)
- They can have **Umbrella Patterns** (similar to Banner Patterns) applied for even more customisation.
  - If enabled in configs, this can also include Pride Flag patterns!
- They can be enchanted with **Gliding**, which gives you a slow falling-like effect when held in the main hand.
  - Gliding also allows entities to be boosted upwards by campfire smoke

Most of these features can also be enabled/disabled/changed via the config file!

Depends on my Core mod, [PneumonoCore](https://modrinth.com/mod/pneumono_core)
